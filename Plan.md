#My Plan

As this is my first design system I'm implementing I decided to start from simply building a functioning mock.
I decided to do it naively and refactor as I go.

Something I learned along the way:
I was quite quickly "fed-up" with configuration and moved to programming. This is fine but there are a few things I would advise to get going from the beginning. Most importantly is the font family. I started with the default fonts, and once I added the font from the design I had to re-visit all component and fix line-heights and margins to have things look nicely.

Final Goal:
Have a working webpage which is 90% pixel-perfect.
Have a StoryBook example of the working prats.
- Typography
- Color pallette
- Common ui elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
Decide - either utility classes / components or a color creator

color creator -> insert base color and it will give you 9 shades you can copy/paste
